# Nested Map Reduce Traversal

This little exercise is based on the post in the Haskell discourse (https://discourse.haskell.org/t/beautiful-functional-programming/7411).
The repo with all the solutions in various languages is https://github.com/josevalim/nested-map-reduce-traversal.

The Python solution is very simple and elegant, can we do the same in Haskell? This is hopefully a good attempt.

Here is the Python solution:
